- [Next Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs)

### Initialize npm to creat a json file

```
npm init
```

### Install Next package

```
npm install -- save next react react-dom
```

### Change the scripts in json:

```
"scripts": {
   "dev": "next",
   "build": "next build",
   "start": "next start"
  },
```

### Created React components folder named pages, with an indexjs. Inside pages, created auth folder with an indesjs file.

#### Create Next pages by running on command line:

```
npm run dev
```

This will spin up the devoloping server and will take you to localhost 300. Next will create routes for the two index pages.
